Description: Extensible Virtual Display Interface driver kernel module
 The Extensible Virtual Display Interface (EVDI) is a Linux kernel
 module that enables management of multiple screens, allowing user-space
 programs to take control over what happens with the image. It is
 essentially a virtual display you can add, remove and receive
 screen updates for, in an application that uses the libevdi library.
 .
 The module and library is part of the DisplayLink Ubuntu development
 which enables support for DisplayLink USB 3.0 devices on Ubuntu.
 .
 Please note that this is NOT a complete driver for DisplayLink devices.
 .
 This package installs the kernel module needed for creating the virtual
 displays.
