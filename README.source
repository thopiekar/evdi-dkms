evdi for Debian
---------------

The source is taken directly from the upstream git repository. The sources
are then modified by the cleanup_script.sh script for removing files
with unclear license terms. (Upstream only clearly states the license
for the subdirectories "library" and "module")

In git full sources are maintained under the "upstream" branch and cleaned
up sources under "dfsg_clean".
